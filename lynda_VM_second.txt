VMWare Workstation

Setting a network
  - Bridged -- Connect directly to the physical network
  - NAT (Network Address Translation) -- Guest and Host to share one IP address.
  - Host Only - A private network shared with the host

Understanding Different File Systems
  VMFS (Virtual Machine File System)
    - Proprietary to VMware
    - Cluster file System
      - Mountd on multiple servers simultaneously
    - Preferred by VMware
  NFS (Network File System)
    - Developed by SUN -- now an open standard
    - Distributed file system
      - Mounted on one server and shared through network
  NTFS (New Technology File System)
    - Mounted on one server, shared via the OS
    - Only option for Hyper-V
    - ReFS (Resilient File System) -- new file system microsoft is working on. (next generation of NTFS based on NTFS)
  RDM (Raw Device Mapping)
    - Absnces of system
    - Files written to unformatted disks
    - Managed by mapping file on VMFS volume

Understanding Storage
  - Direct-Attached Storage (DAS)
    -local hard drive & external physical storage
    -cheapest, easiest
    - does not scale well
  - Network-Attached Storage (NAS)
    - Basic File Servere
    - Runs simple OS that communicates with file system
    - Clients will communicate with OS
    - Typically only one file system supported.
  - Storage area Network (SAN)
    - No OS
    - Client connect directly to File System
    - Appears in clinet as a drive letter
    - Highes performance (expensive)

Configuring Your Network
  - Create separate network for storage (HOST and Storage)
    - performance increase
    - Separate administration
  - Separate network cards on host (more than one adapter)
  - Divide switch using VLAN

  VMs needs to might have problems because of:
  Unique machine name, IP address and MAC address
  Software firewalls on Guest and Host!
  Host network adapter can be
    - non functional,
    - saturated
    - drivers up to date
  Guest network adapter
    - connected to internal || external

  Ghost Network Adapter
    - Driver remains after hardware is removed?!?


VM can be slow because of:
  RESOURCES
  - Processor 
  - Memory
  - Graphics

  Antivirus on Host
  Remove unneeded hardware on guest
   - virtual USB etc.

Duplicating Virtual machine
  - Clone = makign an exact copy
    - IP, MAC, Lycences can be duplicated.
  - Export = Move to different host
  - Clone + Export is better solution

Importing
  - Register
    - Leave files where they are
    - No change to Original, nor copy
    - use when moving from one host to another
  - Restore
    - moves files to default location
    - possible overwrite
    - use when recovering
  - Copy
    - Create new ID and name on clone
    - Use when running side by side


Backing Up a VM
  - install traditional backup software on guest
  - Copy VM files (*.vhd, *.vhdx, *.hdd)
  - Specialty products (may not free)


Converting Physical machine to Virtual machine (P2V)
  - VMware vCenter Converter
  - Microsoft Disk2vhd
  
  both tools can convert while physical server is running
  and free!

  P2V technical issues:
    Data in RAM vs. data on hard drive
      - miss peace of data
    Network sttings
      - manually re-create network
    Drivers might not match
