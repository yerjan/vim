This course covers about virtualization, using virtual machines etc.

Hypervisor:
  hypervisor is a software that creates virtual machine
    - host  -- actual physical machine
    - guest -- virtual machines hosted by hypervisor

  type1 hypervisor
    - called native or bare metal hypervisor
    - software run directly on host's hardware - acting as OS
  type2 hypervisor
    - called hosted hypervisor
    - Runs as an application or service on separate OS

The Cloud:
  - have their own Hypervisor on their hardware
  - provide access to hypervisor with or without VM prebuilt

  public cloud - owned by someone else -- lots of people use it
  private cloud - owned by people using it
  hybrid cloud - combination of public and private

  Types of Service Offered
    - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) -- provide virtual processor, memory
      and disk
    - Platform as a service (PaaS) -- OS, DB server, Application, Web Service
      etc.
    - Software as a service (SaaS) -- typical software that is provided.
      (gmail for example)

                          VIRTUALIZATION ADVANTAGES

Efficient Utilization of Hardware:
  - use what you need, when you need it
  - adjust resources - resize (manual or automated if provided.)
  
  Ex:
    - initial sizing of a server (compared with physical machine, this can be
      changed during use.)
    - Temporary change
    - single processor >> multi Processor might be problem and vs.
    
  - Line migration

  - Disaster recovery
    - save the state of a vm at a point in time (snapshot, checkpoint)
    - recover from that state
      - disk space is duplicated every time snapshot is taken
      - on can only track changed files in disk space using "lazy write"
        - however this can be performance problem
      snapshot is not a good backup because it is located in same VM!

  - Just-In-Time Delivery
    Processor
      - number of processor is fixed however, speed can be increased.
    Memory
      - Amount of RAM - dynamic
        when memory is taken it is called Balooning

                          VIRTUALIZATION DISADVANTAGES

Increase Complexity
  - Network
    - increased load
    - should supply with virtual network devices
    - duplicatad IP addresses and MAC addresses

  - Storage
    - performance problem with local storage
    - Quantity
    - Quality

  - Troubleshooting is difficult.
    
Virtualization of the Desktop
  - problems with desktop is:
    - maintaining and troubleshooting desktop is tidious
    - hardware upgrading is difficult
  - Introducing Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
    - Central server pushs VM to each user
    - Processing typically occurs remotely

Designing private cloud needs to consern:
  - Storage
    - filesystme type
    - Quantity
    - Quality (to avoid bottle neck)
  - Bandwidth
    - Local
    - Remote bandwith
       live migration from one to another
  - Uptime goal
    - 100% uptime is not possible
    - number of hosts (might need to be rebooted)
  - Monitoring
  - Scalability

Public cloud
Amazon Web Service (AWS)
Microsoft Asure are public cloud
Rackspace -- OpenCloud
CenturyLink - Qwest and Savvis
Salesfoce.com CRM solution
Verizon Terremark - Oracle
